# Communication

## Community Communication

- Return users inquiries ASAP, no matter how big or small the matter.
- Listen to users and seek to understand their point of view, no matter how vocal they may be.
- Be proactive in reaching out about potential issues versus waiting for the community to act first.
- Over-communicate as often as possible to ensure both AKASHA and the community are always on the same page.
- Always be appreciative.

## Internal Communication (Core Team)

### General Guidelines

- Communicate proactively! 
- All work information, including discussions and decisions, should only flow through our communication and documentation tools to give everyone equal, easy and systematic access to it.
- Keep your profiles updated. Give your colleagues an easy way to check your time zone, your email address, and, _if you'd like_, your personal website/portfolio/social media profiles.
- Keep your calendar updated to make it easier for others scheduling meetings and catch-ups with you. If you won't be at your workplace during your default working hours, make that explicit in your calendar. 
- During your working hours, your Discord status should be either `Online` or `Do Not Disturb` , so your colleagues know you're around in case they need to get in touch with you. 
- Default to public channels: when in doubt, always post a message where all the core team can read it. Keep everyone updated on stuff that is not private!
 
### Preferred Communication Methods

- Communicate proactively! 
- To ask or discuss general topics, the appropriate Discord channel is your best option.
- To report a bug or to suggest a new feature, use GitHub, either commenting in an existing, related issue or creating a new one.
- Avoid using emails. Discussions over emails are counterproductive. 
- Definitely avoid group email addresses, e.g. everyone@email.com. 

### Embrace Asynchronous

- When you ping someone, go ahead and give that person all the context they’ll need in order to get back to you when they can (e.g., no need to message “Hi Mihai!” and then wait for a reply before saying more). Do include links, docs, your deadline or desired response time, anything that can move the conversation forward asynchronously.
- Whenever possible, respond to all open messages by the end of your workday at the latest.
- Communicate proactively ;-)
