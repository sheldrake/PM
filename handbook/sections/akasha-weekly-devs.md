## Agenda
Altought not a directive, we often use the structure of [Scrum Meetings](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum) as a general guide for our meetings, i.e. each person *can* use the three following questions to guide their own agenda. 

1. What have you done since the last meeting?
1. What do you plan to do until the next meeting?
1. Are there any impediments in your way?
