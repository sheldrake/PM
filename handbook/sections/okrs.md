# OKRs: Objectives and Key Results

## What are OKRs?

OKR stands for Objective & Key Result. Developed by Intel and subsequently championed by the likes of Google and LinkedIn, the OKR framework connects operational objectives and progress to the organization's vision and purpose.

Non-fiscal metrics are essential to securing operational alignment. Nevertheless, the axiom 'you get what you measure' means care is required in framing the objectives and describing the expected key results. In other words, if there might be both a 'right way' and 'wrong way' to achieve the results, the framing should be revised to preclude the 'wrong way'.

Effective OKRs are shared openly to inform those in your team and the wider organization. They serve as a communication framework for directing groups to solve complex challenges with constraints. 

It's common to set all OKRs over a default period, often a quarter or two. This is in line with the emphasis the agile methodology places on delivering what you can in a fixed duration rather than taking the time to deliver everything, and is valuable given the iterative and interconnected nature of OKRs. Longer delivery periods, say annual, don't accommodate the responsiveness we need. Shorter delivery periods, say monthly, might not allow for OKRs to be sufficiently 'meaty'.

Due to their innate stretchiness, it's typical to expect c. 70% OKR achievement.

### Objectives

Any initiative has an objective. Write out what you hope to accomplish such that at a later time you can easily tell if you have reached, or have a clear path to reaching, that objective.

Choosing the right objectives is one of the hardest things to do and requires a great deal of thinking and courage. They are:

* **I**nspiring — only visionary, bold and eloquent objectives excite people and move the organization forward
* **D**ifficult — aim high with stretch goals far from the status quo; should feel uncomfortable rather than comfortable or impossible
* **E**xplicit — clear, concise and easy to understand from a first and brief glance, even for someone unfamiliar with the context
* **A**chievable — only commit on goals that can be nearly or completely accomplished in the OKR period by the assigned team or individual.

### Key Results

Assuming your Objectives are well thought through, Key Results are the secret sauce to using OKRs. Key Results are numerically-based expressions of success or progress towards an Objective.

The important element here is measuring success. It's not good enough to make broad statements about improvement (that are subjectively evaluated). We need to know how well we are succeeding. Qualitative goals tend to under-represent our capabilities because the solution tends to be the lowest common denominator.

e.g If I create a goal to “launch new training for the sales team” I might do that for one sales member. If I alternatively make a Key Result of “train 50 sales team members” and only train 10, I’ve still 10x-ed my original goal.

They are:

* **S**pecific — target a specific area for growth or improvement with little to no room for interpretation
* **M**easurable — quantify or suggest an indicator of progress to track
* **A**ssignable — specify who is accountable (the fewer people the better)
* **R**ealistic — state what results could realistically, even if difficult or aggressive, be achieved given circumstances, dependencies and available resources
* **T**ime-related — if not by default at the end of the given period, specify the date or event by which each result should be achieved.

## Guidelines to define OKRs

### First: the big picture

1. **What is your company mission?** 
   - You should already have a mission. 
   - Take the time to set a company mission
2. **What is the theme for next quarter or two, the one big objective you (as a company) would like to accomplish?**
3. **What are three metrics that would tell you that you had indeed succeeded in that objective?**
4. Check: 
       - Is the Objective inspirational and challenging? 
       - Are these tough KRs? 
       - Do you have only a 50/50 chance of making each KR?
       - Will it really take a quarter or two to do this?  
       - Does it tie together everyone's efforts?
5. **What is one big objective toward your company mission that would take the company 3 months to do, and you are only 50% confident you could do?**
   - Gather ideas for this from team. 
   - Successful OKRS are set together, not handed down. 
6. **What are three metrics that would tell you that you had indeed succeeded?**
7. Check:
    - Is the Objective inspirational and challenging? 
    - Are these tough KRs? 
    - Do you have only a 50/50 chance of making each KR?
    - Will it really take an entire quarter to do this?  
    - Does it tie together everyone's efforts?
    
### Then: for each group/function, i.e. marketing, engineering, product, design

1. **What Objective and three Key Results will you set to support the company OKR?**
2. Check:
    - Are these things you can do without support of other groups? 
    - Are your results actually results, or are they tasks you do to get results? 
       - e.g. Launch a pricing page vs launch a pricing page that has 12% conversion to contact.
    - CEO: do you really believe these will take a full quarter and each KR has only a 50/50 chance of success?
3. **What Objective and three Key Results will you PERSONALLY set to support the company OKR this quarter?**
    - e.g learn new skills, hire great people, show results in your pet project
4. **What big projects are needed to make this happen?**  
   - It becomes the **roadmap**.
   - They are tasks
   - List as many as you wish
   - You can reorder them as often as needed through the quarter to hit the OKRs
   - OKRs don’t change (strategy) but projects and priorities do (tactics). [Validation](http://eleganthack.com/customer-development-with-participatory-roadmaps/)
5. **What steps are taken to make projects happen (priorities) this week!**  
    - will be shared and set weekly in a planning meeting and in email
