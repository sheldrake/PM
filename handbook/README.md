# AKASHA Handbook

This handbook is maintained to serve as a set of guidelines for our community collaborators and core team members on anything related to our culture, processes, practices, roles, and rituals.

We believe that a very well-defined set of guidelines is critical to thrive in a self-organizing environment, as they help each one of us to move deliberately but with a shared vision and shared goals â€“ and without accidentally 'breaking' anything. 

Awesome guidelines helps us to deliver awesome rock-solid products :-)

**This handbook is a continuous work-in-progress. Please, do help to improve it and keep it up to date!**
